\lhead{Introduction}
The rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) seen in the last decade is not just one of research;
fields such as Data Science or AI Engineering have brought emerging intelligent technologies to industry, resulting in AI playing a significant role in society.
This data-driven wave of AI has been led by the subfield that deals with statistical learning such as Deep Neural Networks while symbolic methods using explicit knowledge have been less influential.
The successful societal impact of these statistical methods such as Deep Learning is, however, conditioned on the availability of enough data which has the negative side effect of limiting the benefits of AI to high resource domains.

A clear example of this issue is the important field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) that

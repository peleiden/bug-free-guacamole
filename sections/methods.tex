\subsection{Fine-tuning English LUKE}
Yamada et al. benchmark \emph{LUKE}, their new transformer-based model for contextualized entity representations on a number of Natural Language Processing tasks, including Named Entity Recognition on the CoNLL-2003 dataset \cite{yamada2020luke}.

Reproduction of these results were performed by obtaining the pretrained LUKE models from Yamada et al.'s software repository.

The model was then fine-tuned for NER by training a linear classifier over all $n$-grams in each sentence with the named entities as targets for cross-entropy loss, as described in \cite[Sec. 4.3]{yamada2020luke}.
The same hyper-parameters as Yamada et al. were used and are shown along with and technical details in Table~\ref{tab:params}.

This procedure was repeated five times for each of the two released LUKE models, called \emph{large} and \emph{base}, to examine variability in the downstream training.
